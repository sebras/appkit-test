# Attempt to follow setup instructions

We need to review whether [these instructions](https://mupdf.com/appkit/docs) for
installing MuPDF AppKit can be followed without hitting any big hurdles. This is
my attempt to follow the instructions. The aim is to start with an Android Studio
default app structure, and then at the click of a button open a PDF component to
view a PDF from the Downloads directory on an Android phone.
